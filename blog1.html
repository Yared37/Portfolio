                    Conversations used to be messy. They had sparks. They had yelling. They had silence afterward that smelled like reflection. Now, we talk to each other like we're forensic investigators.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I've noticed it a lot. Someone says something slightly off, and suddenly they're not just wrong. They're insecure, defensive, and probably suffering from unresolved childhood trauma. You nod along, because maybe they are, and maybe that's why you just typed back "interesting perspective".
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Try it next time you talk to someone. Count how many sentences are sentences and how many are diagnoses. It's strange to realize the human being in front of you has been reduced to a case study.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We've stopped arguing. We've started classifying. And if you're honest, part of you likes it. It's safer, cleaner, less terrifying than confrontation. But it's also quietly lonely.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    There's a term for this in psychology. "Therapeutic culture" is what sociologist Frank Furedi calls it in his book <em>Therapy Culture</em>. The language of the therapy room has escaped into everyday life. Everyone's speaking in symptoms now. Attachment styles. Trauma responses. Defense mechanisms. We've imported clinical vocabulary into casual conversation.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Look at Reddit threads or Twitter discourse. Someone shares an opinion about, say, Marvel movies. Within three replies, someone's analyzing their need for external validation or suggesting they're exhibiting signs of cognitive dissonance. The conversation never touches the actual movie. It becomes an armchair diagnosis of the person who dared to have feelings about it.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Esther Perel, the relationship therapist, noticed this shift in her podcast <em>Where Should We Begin?</em>. In one session, she stopped a couple mid-argument and pointed out they were talking about each other instead of to each other. Every statement was a diagnosis. "You do this because you're afraid of intimacy." "You say that because you're controlling." They'd turned their marriage into a case conference.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The tools were supposed to help us understand each other better. Attachment theory, emotional intelligence, trauma-informed language. All genuinely valuable frameworks. But we've weaponized them. Instead of "I feel hurt when you cancel plans," we get "Your avoidant attachment is triggering my anxious attachment."
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    It's the difference between naming your experience and pathologizing someone else's.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Film captures this beautifully. In <em>Marriage Story</em>, there's that scene where the couple's in therapy and they can't stop analyzing each other's motivations. They're so busy explaining why the other person is broken that they forget to just feel their feelings. The therapist eventually tells them to stop. Just stop talking about each other and start talking about themselves.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    At the same time, it makes me wonder how empathy has changed. Are we understanding people better, or are we just observing them? Maybe the next step in learning is to teach ourselves to engage fully, not just explain.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The Atlantic ran a piece in 2023 about "therapy speak" and how it's changed workplace dynamics. Employees were reporting managers to HR for "gaslighting" when they gave critical feedback. Coworkers were calling each other "toxic" for having bad days. The language was being used to shut down conversation rather than open it up.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Here's what's happening. We've confused emotional literacy with diagnostic authority. Knowing what "projection" means doesn't make you qualified to tell someone they're projecting. Reading an Instagram carousel about narcissism doesn't give you the standing to diagnose your ex.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Jonathan Haidt talks about this in <em>The Coddling of the American Mind</em>. He calls it "concept creep." Words that once had specific clinical meanings have expanded to cover basically all uncomfortable human behavior. Trauma used to mean something specific. Now stubbing your toe can be "traumatic." Abuse had a definition. Now a friend forgetting your birthday is "emotional abuse."
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The stakes are real. When everything is pathology, nothing is. When every disagreement becomes a diagnostic opportunity, we lose the ability to just be wrong about things. To be cranky. To have a bad take. To be human in all our flawed, messy glory.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    And look, I get the appeal. Diagnosing feels powerful. You're Neo seeing the Matrix code. You've cracked the pattern. You understand what's really happening beneath the surface. It's intellectually satisfying.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    But most of the time, you're just avoiding actual engagement. It's easier to label someone's behavior than to sit with the discomfort of disagreement. It's simpler to categorize than to be curious.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    David Foster Wallace wrote about this kind of thing in his essay "E Unibus Pluram." He was talking about irony and television, but the insight applies. We've created so many layers of meta-awareness that we can't just experience things anymore. We're always analyzing, always one step removed, always performing insight rather than having genuine reactions.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Real conversations require vulnerability from both sides. They require taking what someone says at face value before you start excavating for hidden meanings. They require the possibility that you might be wrong.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Diagnosis doesn't leave room for any of that. It's a shortcut that looks like depth.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Maybe the next time someone irritates you, before you reach for the pop psychology explanation, just try the old thing. Tell them they're irritating you. See what happens. Have an actual argument. Let it be messy.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    You might be surprised how much more productive it is to treat people like people instead of case studies.
